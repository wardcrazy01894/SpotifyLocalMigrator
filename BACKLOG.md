# Backlog

Rule for every playlist: new playlist is named `<Original> (Spotify version)`;
first pass adds exact matches only (title + artist + duration), then the owner
reviews the flagged breakdown and approves additions by reason or position.
Finished playlists get dragged into the "Old iTunes playlists" folder by hand.

## Done

| Playlist | Songs | Added | Kept local | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pry | 112 | 107 | 5 | https://open.spotify.com/playlist/034PA7UMN27PrxIpRDnI9Q — `verify` COMPLETE 2026-10-07 |

## In progress

| Playlist | Songs | Status |
|---|---|---|
| iPhone | 3262 | https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6RIfz6C47vRfneHYHXO5Sx — day by day. Daily Spotify search budget: 423 songs + ~30 re-searches (2026-10-08), 485 + 23 (2026-10-10), 487 + 8 (2026-10-11) before a 429; rolling 24 h window from the day's first search, currently opens ~13:49. 2026-10-11 end: 2121 searched, 1953 on Spotify (1949 tracks + 4 collapsed duplicates), 148 keep-local, 7 B2 flags awaiting the user (pos 1564,1635,1655,1808,1834,1838,1946), 13 rechecks for tomorrow (pos 1639,1640,1642,1833,1867,1923,1935,1953,2004,2020,2038,2061,2072). |

Daily loop: `python3 migrate.py -w iPhone match --limit 400` → `build` → review `work/iphone/flagged_<date>.csv` →
`approve --pos ... --keep-local ... --recheck ...` → `build` → `verify`.

Standing rules:
- A decision (approve / keep local) made for a song in one playlist applies to the same song in every playlist (`work/approvals.json`).
- A playlist is only done when `verify` says COMPLETE: source count == Spotify tracks in the new playlist + local files dragged in by hand.
